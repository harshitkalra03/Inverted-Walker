# Inverted-Walker
The inverted walker uses a **crankshaft mechanism** powered by two single-shaft BO motors, supported by circuit design, programming, 3D mechanical design and documentation.

## Timeline - 
1. **Day 1:**
- Given the short time of two days, we needed to complete the making of the CAD model of our inverted walker and get it laser cut from cast acrylic within 24 hours.
- We quickly got to making the models going through a few iterations till we settled on a stepper type configuration given its simplicity, feasibility, speed. We then went about a few ways to implement a similar model in solidworks.
- We worked through the iterations until we settled upon the final design.

2. **Day 2:**
- The next day, we got it laser cut and moved in the assembly stage. This is the stage where we found the most problems which we had to deal with on the spot. The first of which was the anchoring each piece with another. We went with the intention of drilling and screwing each 90 degrees.
- We then realised that the acrylic sheets would be too brittle to facilitate this method. This lead us to use some less than ideal adhesives that were available at the time for the fixing of the pieces together.
- Another problem was the absence of appropriate bolts in our area (for the fixing of the moving joints) which lead to some major setbacks in our timeline while we searched for appropriate solutions.
- Eventually, we were able to find just enough screws and also figured out a way to use less screws. But thats not all, we still encountered other problems like the immobility of some of the joints which lead us to create some makeshift elongated washers using heat sinks. We also tried different configurations of the mechanical system including one using an arduino to control the motors individally.

3. **Day 3:**
- Night turned to day where we continued to work on the inverted walker. Now we worked mainly on the weight reduction of the bot by the removal of redundant material using a heated blade which a long but nescissary.
- We also worked on the weight balancing of the bot and the alignment of the arms. We found the optimal position of the motors and fixed them onto the battery cover. We also worked on the circutry of the system which considering our other challanges was rather easy.

## Machinery - 
  - CO2 laser cutter
  - Drills along with appropriate drill bits

## Possible Applications  
  - The actual implementation of an abrasive blaster as well as a spray paint system for the application of the anti-corrosive layer.
  - An induction charger is used to change the electric fields of the high-tension wires to power the walker.

##We had a discussion into the possable impacts of our technology in certain areas -
The decrease in cost and increase in efficiency of the power lines will lead to a decrease in consumer rates, more significant investments in other infrastructure, and an increase in the profits of the power supply company. This also increases the safety of the workers who might have to interact with these high-voltage wires for maintenance. It can also reduce the waste produced by the corroded wires, making it more environmentally sustainable. Similar designs can also be used for the easy and safe inspection of steel cables in bridges with the help of ultrasonic modules, vibration measurements, etc. Another niche application of this technology is the maintenance of zipline cables through cleaning, applying anti-corrosive layers, and safely removing dust, snow, and other debris.
