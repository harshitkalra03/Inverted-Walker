# Inverted-Walker
The inverted walker uses a crankshaft mechanism powered by two single-shaft BO motors, supported by circuit design, programming, 3D mechanical design and documentation.

## Design Process
Given the time limitations we had to design the CAD model in under a day which had to CO2 laser cut. This meant that we had to run through a few iterations of the basic design of the inverted-walker. We settled on a design which incorporated a crank-shaft (stepper) mechanism.
