# Inverted-Walker
The inverted walker uses a crankshaft mechanism powered by two single-shaft BO motors, supported by circuit design, programming, 3D mechanical design and documentation.

Timeline - 
Day 1:
Given the short time of a few days, we needed to complete the making of the CAD model of our inverted walker and get it laser cut from cast acrylic within 24 hours. We quickly got to making the models going through a few iterations till we settled on a stepper type configuration given its simplicity, feasibility, speed. We then went about a few ways to implement a similar model in solidworks. We worked through the iterations until we settled upon the final design.




Day 2:
The next day, we got it laser cut and moved in the assembly stage. This is the stage where we found the most problems which we had to deal with on the spot. The first of which was the anchoring each piece with another. We went with the intention of drilling and screwing each 90 degrees. We then realised that the acrylic sheets would be too brittle to facilitate this method. This lead us to use some less than ideal adhesives that were available at the time for the fixing of the pieces together. Another problem was the absence of appropriate bolts in our area (for the fixing of the moving joints) which lead to some major setbacks in our timeline while we searched for appropriate solutions. Eventually, we were able to find just enough screws and also figured out a way to use less screws. But thats not all, we still encountered other problems like the immobility of some of the joints which lead us to create some makeshift elongated washers using heat sinks.
